# Predicting Attack Type in Global Terrorist Events

## Overview/Synopsis
Analyses of terrorist groups and incidents have begun to recognize the evolutionary nature of terrorism, as well as its ability to adapt to counter-terrorism tactics. This project is intended to predict the clusters of terrorist attack using attack type, weapon type, target type, terrorist group type.
